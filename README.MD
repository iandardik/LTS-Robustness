# Safe Environmental Envelopes of Discrete Systems

This repository contains a tool for calculating transition-based robustness of discrete systems.
This tool is the artifact for the paper "Safe Environmental Envelopes of Discrete Systems", accepted to CAV'23.


## Structure and Content

This project contains the following folders:
- bin: contains the executable jar for our tool, LTS-Robustness.jar.
- benchmarks: contains the case studies from our paper, as well as scripts to run them.
- robustifier: contains the source files we used to build this project.


## Set Up

### Set up from OVA file
Install VirtualBox.
You can then open SafeEnvEnvelopes.ova and start a VM.
Once the VM is started, the desktop will show a terminal whose present working directory is a local copy of this repository.
No more set up is required; we have already built the tool and packaged it into bin/LTS-Robustness.jar.

### Local set up from git
Clone this repository to your local machine.
No more set up is required; we have already built the tool and packaged it into bin/LTS-Robustness.jar.

## Replicating Results from the Paper

### Instructions
We have provided two shell scripts for replicating the results from Table 1 in the paper.
Both scripts are located in the benchmarks/ folder:
```
cd benchmarks
```
To run Algorithm 1 with our heuristic ("Wall Heur" in Table 1):
```
./run_heur.sh
```
To run Algorithm 1 without the heuristic ("Wall Plain" in Table 1):
```
./run_plain.sh
```

### Sample
Here is a sample for the expected result from running Algorithm 1 with our heuristic:
```
$ ./run_heur.sh
~/Documents/CMU/tolerance-permissiveness/LTS-Robustness/benchmarks/running_example ~/Documents/CMU/tolerance-permissiveness/LTS-Robustness/benchmarks

Running Example
---------------
time java -jar ../../bin/LTS-Robustness.jar --verbose --env env.lts --ctrl ctrl.lts --prop p.lts --largest-delta-size
WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.
# states in E: 4
# states in C: 2
# states in P: 4
#alpha: 2
#W: 6
#delta: 3
Size of largest delta element: 13

real	0m0.396s
user	0m0.560s
sys	0m0.058s

~/Documents/CMU/tolerance-permissiveness/LTS-Robustness/benchmarks
~/Documents/CMU/tolerance-permissiveness/LTS-Robustness/benchmarks/therac25 ~/Documents/CMU/tolerance-permissiveness/LTS-Robustness/benchmarks
.
.
.
```

The output above is a "sample" because there will be more output (from running the rest of the benchmarks).
From top to bottom, here is how to interpret the output:
- The script is changing directories to running_example.
- The script is now calculating robustness for the benchmark "Running Example".
- The script is executing the tool using the command: "time java -jar ../../bin/LTS-Robustness.jar --verbose --env env.lts --ctrl ctrl.lts --prop p.lts --largest-delta-size".
- The tool detects 4 states in the environment, 2 states in the controller, and 4 states in the safety property.
- The tool detects 2 actions between all FSP inputs.
- The size of the winning set is 6.
- After calculating robustness, the size of delta is 3, and the largest maximal robust deviation has size 13.
- The wall time for the tool is 0.396 seconds ("real" indicates wall time).
- The script is changing to the therac25 directory to continue running.


## Using the Tool

### Help Menu
We provide a help menu for the tool.
Here is the result of printing the help menu from the root directory of this project:

By default, the tool uses Algorithm 1 with our heuristic to compute robustness.
The "--bf" option will use the "plain" version of Algorithm 1 to calculate robustness.

### Basic Usage
In this section we will show to to calculate robustness for a controller ctrl.lts, environment env.lts, and safety property p.lts.
The .lts extension indicates that the file contains a valid [FSP](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jnm/LTSdocumention/FSP-notation.html) program.
FSP is the language used to specify automaton in [LTSA](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/).

To calculate robustness for a ctrl.lts, env.lts, and p.lts, use the following command:
```
$ java -jar bin/LTS-Robustness.jar --ctrl ctrl.lts --env env.lts --prop p.lts
```

It is also possible to add one or more environment properties (denoted as P_env in the paper).
For example, if we want to include (the conjunction of) two environment properties envp1.lts and envp2.lts, then we use the following command:
```
$ java -jar bin/LTS-Robustness.jar --ctrl ctrl.lts --env env.lts --prop p.lts --env-prop envp1.lts --env-prop envp2.lts
```

By default, the tool displays robustness in a set format.
The tool can also display robustness using DOT and FSP format, using the --print-dot and --print-fsp flags respectively.
The tool can also print the size of the largest maximal robust deviation using the flag --largest-delta-size.

The tool can also be used to compare robustness between controllers and properties.
For example, if we want to compare the robustness of ctrl.lts to the robustness of a different controller ctrl2.lts, then we could use the following command:
```
$ java -jar bin/LTS-Robustness.jar --ctrl ctrl.lts --env env.lts --prop p.lts --ctrl ctrl2.lts --compare-ctrl
```

### Therac-25 Example
In this section we will provide an example of how to manually run the Therac-25 case study, including comparing its robustness to the Therac-20.
To compute the robustness of the Therac-25, begin by changing to the Therac-25 benchmark directory.
From the root directory:
```
cd benchmarks/therac25
```

The following command will calculate robustness for the Therac-25:
```
java -jar ../../bin/LTS-Robustness.jar --env env_safe.lts --ctrl sys.lts --prop p.lts --env-prop envp_term.lts
```

The following command will compare the robustness for the Therac-25 against the Therac-20:
```
java -jar ../../bin/LTS-Robustness.jar --env env_safe.lts --ctrl sys.lts --prop p.lts --env-prop envp_term.lts --ctrl sys_interlock.lts --compare-ctrl
```
